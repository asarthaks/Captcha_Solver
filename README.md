# Captcha_Solver

Implemented Captcha Solver using CNN, OpenCV library

Steps :

1) Seperate each character of a captcha and store it --> Seperating each character.ipynb
2) Automate the process for all captcha and prepare our dataset --> Seperate_All_Captchas.ipynb
3) Create out CNN and train it on out dataset --> Model.ipynb
4) Use trained CNN to predict the characters of a captcha --> Using model to solve captcha.ipynb
